SortingAI_0.4
	World have been extended to support sorting of four different kinds of balls. Likewise the code have been updated to support these changes. The first test was done with a ball spawning every 0.2 second. It might have been to fast, and another test with a spawning rate of 0.5 or maybe 1 is needed to confirm wheter im shit at programming or it simply is to fast.

	Training was done in time-scale=5

SortingAI_0.4.1
	Test was done with a spawnrate of 0.5 and multiple changes to the world to ensure the balls was falling as intended. But still the results were disapointing, so another test is underway!
